# Syntax highlighting of MARC and related record formats

This repository contains **syntax highlighting rules** of Machine-Readable
Cataloging (MARC) and related [record formats](formats), such as PICA+.

## Give me highlighting!

Syntax highlighting has been implemented for these [highlighting systems](languages) so far:

* [vim](vim/) editor
* [CodeMirror](codemirror/) (HTML)
* [Prism](prism/) (HTML, only PICA+ supported by now)

*Contributions [are welcome](https://github.com/gbv/lipstick)!*

## Lipstick?

The name of this repository was inspired by writings of Roy Tennant who also
coined the classic slogan "MARC Must Die" (2002). In 2005 he wrote about
library catalog redesign: 

> You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still very much a pig.
