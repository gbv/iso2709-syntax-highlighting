# Syntax highlighting for ISO 2709 based record formats

This repository contains **syntax highlighting rules** for MARC an related
record formats based on or influenced by ISO 2709.

**Disclaimer** I have never read ISO 2709 nor do I think that it is relevant.
because it is not freely available. The basic ideas and concepts of ISO 2709
are relevant only through their actual implementations in MARC and related
formats.
